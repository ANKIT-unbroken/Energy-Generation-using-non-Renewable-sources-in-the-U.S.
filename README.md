Plants with the highest energy generation

The United States uses and produces many different types and sources of energy, which can be grouped into general categories such as primary and secondary, renewable and nonrenewable, and fossil fuels.


Primary energy sources include fossil fuels (petroleum, natural gas, and coal), nuclear energy, and renewable sources of energy. Electricity is a secondary energy source that is generated (produced) from primary energy sources.


The data we are dealing with is different non-renewable energy generation sources in different states across the United States.

 The first chart is created represents the top plants that are generating the highest power using non-renewable sources i.e., coal followed by Natural gas.


 The 3,750MW West County Energy Center in  Florida has the highest power generation using Natural Gas as the prime source that cost FPL around $1.2bn.

The plant provides electricity to 250,000 homes.


2.Top states with highest power generation




Texas is the top crude oil and natural gas-producing state in the nation.


In the united states, Texas is considered to be the state which has the highest number of coal reserves and produces the highest numbers of energy generation than any other state.

Texas leads the nation in wind-powered generation and produced about 28% of all U.S. wind-powered electricity


Texas produces more electricity than any other state, generating almost twice as much as Florida, the second-highest electricity-producing state



3.Utilities with the highest energy among various sources


The representation of the highest energy generation utilities along with their sources i.e., Natural gas is at the top followed by coal, wind, solar.

Florida Power & Light is the biggest Natural Gas utility in the Sunshine State with almost 4.9 million customers across the peninsula.
